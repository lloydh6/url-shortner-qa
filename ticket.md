# URL Shortening Service User Story

## Title: Implement URL Shortening Service

**As a** user of the URL shortening service  
**I want** to be able to shorten long URLs, retrieve original URLs from shortened ones, and follow shortened URLs  
**So that** I can easily share and manage links with a more compact representation

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. The service provides three main endpoints: Encode, Decode, and Follow
2. Shortened URLs are stored in memory (no persistent storage required)
3. The service handles encoding and decoding algorithms internally
4. The service returns consistent shortened URLs for the same input URL
5. The service handles non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, and security

## Acceptance Tests:

### 1. Encode Endpoint:

- Given a valid long URL in the request body
- When a POST request is made to the encode endpoint
- Then the response should be in JSON format
- And the response should contain a shortened URL
- And subsequent requests with the same long URL should return the same shortened URL

### 2. Decode Endpoint:

- Given a valid shortened URL in the request body
- When a POST request is made to the decode endpoint
- Then the response should be in JSON format
- And the response should contain the original long URL

### 3. Follow Endpoint:

- Given a valid shortened URL
- When a GET request is made to the follow endpoint with the shortened URL
- Then the service should redirect to the original long URL

### 4. Error Handling:

- Given an invalid URL or shortened URL
- When a request is made to any endpoint
- Then the service should return an appropriate error message and status code

### 5. Performance:

- Given 1000 concurrent requests to the encode endpoint
- When the requests are processed
- Then the average response time should be less than 100ms

### 6. Security:

- Given a malicious URL containing XSS or SQL injection attempts
- When the URL is submitted to the encode endpoint
- Then the service should sanitize the input and prevent any security vulnerabilities

### 7. Input Validation:

- Given various types of invalid inputs (e.g., empty strings, non-URL strings, extremely long URLs)
- When these inputs are submitted to any endpoint
- Then the service should handle them gracefully and return appropriate error messages
